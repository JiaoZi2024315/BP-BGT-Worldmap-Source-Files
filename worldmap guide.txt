A guide to make a worldmap


1. Open BP-BGT_Worldmap_v7.0.x.xcf file with gimp (latest version: http://www.gimp.org/downloads/  )
2. In the layer menu you can change between the languages. Make the language you need visible and the other languages invisible.
   The layers are sorted alphabetical: First are all labels without translation, then the one with translation, then all labels with different positions for large and huge worldmap.
   The article 'The' at the beginning is not used for alphabetical order, this means 'The giant hills' is not sorted in 'T' but in 'G' for 'giant'
   'deutsch' means 'german' :)
   The layer order for a city is: the text for the name, background for the text, city picture
   The language order is always the same: english, german, italian, polish, spanish
3. After all changes and paintings are finished go to: Image --> Merge visible layers... 
                                                       Filters --> Artistic --> Clothify... (depth = 2)
                                                       Colors --> Curves... (open file 'worldmap color curve')
4. Then Save the file as an *.bmp file in the 'bmp to mos to moz' (This have to be done for all 5 languages and the 2 sizes = 10 times)
5. Install dltcep70.exe and go into setup
   Look for the chitin.key path
   IMPORTANT: look for the checkmark by 'read only' put it away!!!
   Ignore the errors
   Edit --> Image(mos) --> Load external Mos (change file type to Bitmap bmp) and open the worldmap *.bmp 
   Save Mos As --> *.mos (Only 8 characters) in the 'bmp to mos to moz' (I use i.e. en_large.mos, de_small.mos)
6. Use mospack to make a compressed *.moz file

You can use this code for example:

mospack -s en_small.mos
mospack -s de_large.mos
mospack -s de_small.mos
mospack -s it_large.mos
mospack -s it_small.mos
mospack -s po_large.mos
mospack -s po_small.mos
mospack -s es_large.mos
mospack -s es_small.mos
mospack -s en_large.mos
   
In the 'bmp to mos to moz' directory you find the mospack.exe and the mospack.bat file

7. Copy all the *.moz files into the right language folders in the Bp-BGT_worldmap and rename it.
